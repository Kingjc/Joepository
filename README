Hello new reader!

This glorious waste of valuable internet space is my dominion!

I, Joe, have dubbed this land the Joepository, and you are welcome to stay and have a look
around; however, you may not find anything of use quite yet.

Joe and his fellow disciples of Joe are a small team working to make the Joepository a 
better place. Soon we hope to have a coffee table, maybe even a lawn chair!

Please do keep us in mind if you wish for a place to watch words on a screen.
